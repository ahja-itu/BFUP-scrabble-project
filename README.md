# BFUP scrabble project for the group Ghost Variables


Comments to the ones checking this assignment:

- We want to excuse the slight spaghetty-ish code, but clean code was
  not in scope of this project - making it work was
- We've implemented our own Gaddag and use that. 

## Assignments requirements met:

Requirements copied from the `scrabble.pdf` file

- [X] Two points for playing against yourself on an infinite board. You do not have to play well but you have to be able to stay in the game. Continuous passing is not playing the game ;). (Mandatory)
- [ ] One point for playing against other people and implementing a Trie or a Gaddag as your dictionary
- [ ] One point for being able to parse and finish a game on all boards using the DSL
- [X] One point for parallelising the algorithm.
- [ ] One point for writing an algorithm that respects the timeout flag

**NOTE**: for the point for parallelising the algorithm, we argue that we succeeded
with this requirement beginning around line 136 in `ScrabbleTemplate/Scrabble.fs`.
